# description
This project was created to contain my official portfolio website as a web designer. My motivation while creating this website is to add to it every step of the way on my journey of learning to code, ergo the background image on the website! This website as it develops and grows along with me will include all of my major accomplishments, projects, and milestones as a coder.

# front end 
To create a responsive mobile design I have used Bootstraps grid system and all of its diverse classes. Defining rows and columns allowed me to resize aspects of the website when the viewport size is changed. Doing this from the smallest viewport (an iPhone s) and working my way up to an iPad screen size and then a computer monitor allowed me to create this website that is responsive on all viewport sizes. 


The design of the website is modeled after some screenshots I was provided from my class, however, I changed the colors, background, orientation of the links when the navbar is enlarged, and a few other aspects. I wanted this website to be my style and yet close enough to the screenshots to prove that I can replicate the design and am knowledgeable enough to make the site function.
